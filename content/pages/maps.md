# What are hazardous waste facilities? What are the health impacts? 

Hazardous waste facilities are regulated sites that are allowed to produce, treat, store, and dispose hazardous waste. In addition to the over 100 permitted sites throughout California, there are also hundreds of sites throughout the State that are undergoing cleanup, investigation, or enforcement for known or suspected contamination issues. These facilities and sites expose communities to a variety of chemicals that can increase the likelihood of cancer, respiratory diseases, neurological, reproductive, and developmental problems. 

The environmental justice (EJ) movement rose in the 1970s from the group of residents in Warren County, North Carolina who fought against the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in their community. This was one of the first prominent examples highlighting the disproportionate exposure to hazardous waste low-income communities of color face throughout the country. This fight also led to the seminal report by the United Church of Christ’s Commission for Racial Justice titled Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States.  This report, and other subsequent studies, have found that low-income communities and communities of color are more likely to live close to high-polluting industries, hazardous waste facilities, and incinerators.

# What is environmental racism?

Since its inception, the EJ movement coined the concept of environmental racism to describe how Black, Indigenous, and communities of color (BIPOC) are disproportionately exposed to toxic and hazardous waste based on race. Environmental racism calls out the barriers, laws, regulations, and policies our government uses to allow the placement of and the unequal protection the government provides to BIPOC communities from the dangers of hazardous waste facilities. 
Southeast Los Angeles (SELA) provides an example of environmental racism in California. SELA communities abut the City of Vernon which hosts several hazardous waste facilities and several brownfields with known or potential contamination. These sites did not appear randomly but are rather a result of the intentional land use planning and laws which have allowed for multiple sources of hazardous waste to co-exist in or near BIPOC communities. 

# Why these maps?

The data on the hazardous waste facilities and sites throughout the State was obtained through the Department of Toxic Substances Control’s Envirostor database.

# Why schools? 

School-age children spend a significant amount number of hours in schools. Every school day nearly 50.7 million school-aged children spend at least six hours in schools across the country. Many of these schools are located in close proximity to or at time, built on top of, hazardous waste sites.  As a result, the school locations are considered a key determinant of exposure to toxic pollutants. 

Infants and children also have unique biological vulnerabilities and age-related patterns of exposure which make them more vulnerable to health impacts. For example, children consume more food, water, and breath more air per pound of body weight per day than an adult. Additionally, children are less able than adults to break down and excrete certain types of toxic compounds. Children also have more years of life than most adults and therefore have more time to develop chronic health conditions that could stem from early exposures. 
Environmental justice studies have found race and class inequities in the distribution of schoolchildren and schools near environmental hazards. In Los Angeles, minority students in LAUSD are more likely than their white counterparts to attend schools that are close to hazardous waste facilities. Latinos are more likely to attend schools near hazardous facilities and face higher health risks associated with toxic air emissions. 
US EPA created a Healthy School Environments Assessment Tool in 2006 to provide school districts guidance on the health and safety issues facing new and existing school sites. The guidance established guidelines to ensure children’s environmental health concerns are considered in the siting, construction, and remediation of new schools.
A study based in Boston found that schools with disproportionately higher percentages of minority and economically disadvantaged schoolchildren are more likely to be located within a 1 mile radius Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) sites. The study also found a correlation between schools near TRI sites and low academic performance at the school level, as measured by English language art, math, and science Composite Performance Index scores.

# Gaps in hazardous waste law

There are certain policies school districts in California must consider when deciding where to site new public schools. These policies have not changed since [20XX?] despite the increase development of charter schools in the state.
